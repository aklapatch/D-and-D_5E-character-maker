# D-and-D_5E-character-maker
Aids in making characters for D and D 5th edition (since it takes to long to do it manually for me)

If I ever make the program, it will be based on that excel sheet (that excel document is at least useful right now)

Currently the program does not work, and it will probably take me a long time to develop it.
