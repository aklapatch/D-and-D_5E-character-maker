plans in general. I am going to use a combination of enums and strings to arrange data. For example, the Languga string array will
have all the languages in it, but if I put in the enum for that languange name, that will select the string with that name in it.
orgainzational example, to intialize the Language class, the Language class will only allow a member of the Language enum which will select
the correct name and string for that particular object

for expandability The program will read all things from text files.


functions:
int Selectitem(int listnum, std::string* items, std::string descirptor )
holds an array of strings that prints them as 
1. string 1
2. string 2
3. string 3
etc
at that point, a number will be entered, and the function will return that item selected.
Using roll will always be the last option.


Roll(int max)
rolls from 1 to max, using c++11 rng

each race will have its flaws, bonds Ideals, Features/traits and equipment inside of it.
I will need to make all the least common denomenator objects first, before making bigger ones like people or classes

object list:

object (this is a generic object with a constructor and destructor that all basic objects will inherit

Race: 
Flaws
Bonds
Ideals
Features/traits
Languages/Proficiencies
Class
Weapons
Tools
equipment
